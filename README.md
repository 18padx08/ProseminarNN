# ProseminarNN
Neural-Network used to reconstruct either a 3 or a 6 from a noisy input picture. 
Start by pressing LoadData button to start training. As it trains you can see the imporvements of the network live, but just drawing on the
blue rectangle.
Controll the noise with the slider. NOTE: some noise is required, since otherwise the bias of the network will always output the same.
